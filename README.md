# How to use codes?
1. If you are plannng to use Facial Recognition codes, remember to unzip 'FaceDatabaseATT' and place it into Matlab's current folder before running the test codes.          
2. While using Object_Recognition_and_counting_Video.mlx note to use still background videos with only target object moving.                         
3. Note that Training_Deep_Learning_Dataset_Fish.mlx is CPU intensive, it is advisable to run such task on a GPU for optimal performance. To use this set of codes do prepare required datasets for codes to train on.
